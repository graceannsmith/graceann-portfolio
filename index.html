  Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming
  portfolio. Do not use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap. Begin your work with an empty page and an
  initial empty commit.

  Your CSS stylesheet must be named styles.css and reside in a css directory. Your HTML file page must be called
  index.html. You are not required to use Bootstrap styling in your project but you are welcome to do so — especially if
  you have enough time for further exploration at the end of the day.

  Your project should include the following:

  Your name.
  An image of you, or something that represents you.
  A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories.
  For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.
  An “About Me” section.
  Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).
  Your current interests, hobbies, and skills.
  A gh-pages branch so that your site may be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio.
  Don't forget your Git commits with an initial commit and a commit for every major code change, and include a README in
  your GitHub repository!

  instructor will review your code for the following objectives:

  The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, and span.
  Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses typography styles, the box model (including margin, border, and
  padding), and floats.
  Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only
  necessary comments and debugging tools.
  Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…"
  The project repo contains a README that includes:
  application name
  names of contributors
  description of application
  link to site on GitHub Pages
  a "technologies used" section
  application setup instructions
  link to site on GitHub Pages
  a "known bugs" section
  copyright, date, and license information
  Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.
  Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
  The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

  Independent Projects Overview
  Welcome to your first independent project at Epicodus! Before you begin, please carefully review the Independent
  Projects and Code Reviews lesson.

  Portfolio Landing Page
  Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming
  portfolio. Do not use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap. Begin your work with an empty page and an
  initial empty commit.

  Your CSS stylesheet must be named styles.css and reside in a css directory. Your HTML file page must be called

  Objectives
  Your instructor will review your code for the following objectives:

  The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, and span.
  Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses typography styles, the box model (including margin, border, and
  padding), and floats.

  The project repo contains a README that includes:
  application name
  names of contributors
  description of application
  link to site on GitHub Pages
  a "technologies used" section
  application setup instructions
  link to site on GitHub Pages
  a "known bugs" section
  copyright, date, and license information
  Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.
  Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
  The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
  What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
  When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

  You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing
  information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure.
  You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.
  What are the baseline project requirements?
  All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

  A complete and informative README
  The project's commit history demonstrates that the project’s required work schedule and hours have been met:
  8 hours completed on Friday is required for full-time students
  4 hours completed over the weekend is required for part-time students
  Completion of the project based on the prompt and objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and
  features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work
  session to make sure that you are not missing anything.
  Further Exploration
  If you finish the objectives with time to spare, consider adding additional features such as:

  Using bootstrap to style your elements.
  Explore and incorporate animations with CSS.
  Look through this list of HTML elements and incorporate one or more into your project.
  Look through this list of Markdown elements and incorporate one or more into your README.
  Submission
  Scroll down a bit further to the section called Submission. Make sure that you:

  Input the GitHub repository URL containing your project into the Submission link input.
  Do not submit the link to your live GitHub Pages site, i.e.: your-username.github.io/your-portfolio. Instead, submit
  the link to the GitHub repository containing your code, i.e.: github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git.
  Add a submission note for your teacher to review
  Complete the survey
  Confirm that you "have read and understand the guidelines for Independent Projects" by checking the checkbox.
  Hit the submit button — you will be taken to a confirmation page.
  On the submission confirmation page, select whether or not you want to request a meeting with your teacher
  Deadlines
  The deadlines for the initial submission are:

  Friday at 5:00 pm for full-time students.
  Sunday at 8:00 am for part-time students.
  Keep in mind that resubmission deadlines are different! Visit the Independent Projects and Code Reviews lesson for
  details on deadlines, how to submit your code, how feedback works, and course completion requirements.

  Objectives
  Your project will be reviewed on the following objectives:
  The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, and span.

  Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses typography styles, the box model (including margin, border, and
  padding), and floats.

  Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only
  necessary comments and debugging tools.

  Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase 'It will...'

  The project repo contains a README that includes: application name, contributor names, application description, link
  to site on GitHub Pages, a technologies used section, setup instructions, a known bugs section, and copyright, date,
  and license info.

  Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.

  Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
