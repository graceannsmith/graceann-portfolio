  Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming
  portfolio. Do not use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap. Begin your work with an empty page and an
  initial empty commit.

  Your CSS stylesheet must be named styles.css and reside in a css directory. Your HTML file page must be called
  index.html. You are not required to use Bootstrap styling in your project but you are welcome to do so — especially if
  you have enough time for further exploration at the end of the day.

  Your project should include the following:

  Your name.
  An image of you, or something that represents you.
  A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories.
  For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.
  An “About Me” section.
  Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).
  Your current interests, hobbies, and skills.
  A gh-pages branch so that your site may be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio.
  Don't forget your Git commits with an initial commit and a commit for every major code change, and include a README in
  your GitHub repository!

  instructor will review your code for the following objectives:

  Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only
  necessary comments and debugging tools.
  Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…"
  The project repo contains a README that includes:
  application name
  names of contributors
  description of application
  link to site on GitHub Pages
  a "technologies used" section
  application setup instructions
  link to site on GitHub Pages
  a "known bugs" section
  copyright, date, and license information
  Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.
  Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
  The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
